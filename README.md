#I am beginner and very new to use Selenium and C# together #especially in Page Object Design. First of all thanks for #community and tutorials to give me lot of information to made #project! Achieved by Selenium Webdriver.
#I am certain Test Cases can be done another way or easier way #in the code.

##Unfortunately, When I Would have liked to do Test Cases ##using Gherkin(that was also totally new to me) and watched ##tutorials what is this and how to do and realized that, I ##should have done that from the beginning....

##I know that, I could have used existing code for this, but I ##did not want to start it nearly completly over from the  ##fundamental.
##BTW, I Would have liked to use SpecFlow together with Visual ##Studio

Used softwares for development:
 - Visual Studio
 - Chrome
